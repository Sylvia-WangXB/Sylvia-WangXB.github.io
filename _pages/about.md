<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a second-year graduate student from [Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems](https://accu.cqu.edu.cn/kxyj/yjs/jqryznxtyjs.htm), [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/). 
My research interest includes robotics, computer vision and vision-language models.

I have published 1 paper about [multi-agent navigation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9943205) during my undergraduate years.
